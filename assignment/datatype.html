    <h1>**   DATA TYPES IN JAVASCRIPT     **</h1>
<!--
    There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories:
    1)primitive (or primary):
          String
          Number
          Boolean
    2)composite (or reference):
          Object
          Array
          Function
    3)special data types:
          Undefined
          Null
    
    Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities.
    
    *The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters)
    eg:  var a = 'Hello';
    
    *The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place,  or numbers written using exponential notatioN
    eg: var b=19;
    
    *The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false.Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons in a program.
    eg: var x=2,y=3;
        x=y;
        output:false
    
    *The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.
    eg: var a;
        alert(a)
        Output: undefined
    
    *This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value 
    eg:var a = null;
       alert(a);
       Output: null
        
    
    *An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects.
    eg:info = {
        name:"Teena",
        hobby:"Coding",
    }
    
    *An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. An array is created  by specifying the array elements as a comma-separated list enclosed by square brackets
    eg:fruits = ["mango", "apple"];
    
    *The function is callable object that executes a block of code.
    eg:function func()
       {
           console.log("hi");
       }-->
